Do you know my latest album -- [The Private Session Musicals Vol.1][0]?

I put all my love into the production of this masterpiece and only worked with some of the best professionals nowadays.

The Piano is played by Dominik Franke, a brilliant pianist and musical director who is working on many class A theatre productions.

The cello is played by Ariane Spiegel, a member of the famous formation NEO BAROCK which were honoured with one of the most important awards in european music business -- ECHO Klassik

The music has been recorded at the [RecPublica Studios][1] with a very rare FAZIOLI 228 Piano. The Studio was especially built for and around this excellent piano that will touch your soul.   
By using some of the finest microphones on the market (Brauner; Neumann) we ensured that you will listen to an excellent quality of sound. To complete your listening-experience I took the recordings to MasterLab, Berlin to get finished -- one of the best mastering studios worldwide. 

Last but not least I created a very special first edition with a golden embossing print and a sticker of my logo, which is only available with the CD. A real collectors pearl. You will love it!

The album is also available for download, e.g. on [iTunes ][2]
