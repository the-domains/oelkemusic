Do you know my latest album -- [_The Private Session Musicals Vol.1_][0]?
![Brigitte Oelke - The Private Session Musicals Vol.1](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/5ec504c3eb49ad6f476fe65283c150bec9a73bf5.jpg)

I put all my love into the production of this masterpiece and only worked with some of the best professionals nowadays.

[Watch the german promotion video][1]

The Piano is played by _Dominik Franke_, a brilliant pianist and musical director who is working on many class A theatre productions.

The cello is played by _Ariane Spiegel_, a member of the famous formation [_NEO BAROCK_][2] which were honored with one of the most important awards in european music business -- _[ECHO Klassik][3]_

The music has been recorded at the [_RecPublica Studios_][4] with a rare _FAZIOLI 228_ Piano. The studio was especially built for and around this excellent piano that will touch your soul gently. ![Brigitte Oelke & Michal Wasyl (Audio Engineer)](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/bdd829b139f8b3eddae8a753bd4b2499ec97a74b.jpg)

By using some of the finest microphones on the market (_Brauner_; _Neumann_) we ensured that you will listen to an excellent quality of sound. To complete your listening-experience I took the recordings to [_MasterLab_][5], Berlin to get finished -- one of the leading mastering studios worldwide. ![Microphones on FAZIOLI 228](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/db64ed45e31ea40b3f6e475147d57174a5d1c8a4.jpg)

Last but not least I created a very special first edition of the Audio-CD with a golden embossy print and a sticker, which is only available with the CD. A real collectors pearl. You will love it!
