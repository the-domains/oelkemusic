Do you know my latest album -- [_The Private Session Musicals Vol.1_][0]?
![Brigitte Oelke - The Private Session Musicals Vol.1](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/74b3ce01-21c2-48cb-9061-d26d7857ea4f.jpg)

I put all my love into the production of this masterpiece and only worked with some of the best professionals nowadays.

The Piano is played by _Dominik Franke_, a brilliant pianist and musical director who is working on many class A theatre productions.

The cello is played by _Ariane Spiegel_, a member of the famous formation [_NEO BAROCK_][1] which were honored with one of the most important awards in european music business -- _[ECHO Klassik][2]_

The music has been recorded at the [_RecPublica Studios_][3] with a rare _FAZIOLI 228_ Piano. The studio was especially built for and around this excellent piano that will touch your soul gently. ![Brigitte Oelke & Michal Wasyl (Audio Engineer)](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/332f7d9e6d40f83af1a70497249f112306c3546f.jpg)

By using some of the finest microphones on the market (_Brauner_; _Neumann_) we ensured that you will listen to an excellent quality of sound. To complete your listening-experience I took the recordings to [_MasterLab_][4], Berlin to get finished -- one of the leading mastering studios worldwide. ![Microphones on FAZIOLI 228](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/7c9c1e448112000915fa186d688e218accbcb0ee.jpg)

Last but not least I created a very special first edition with a golden embossy print and a sticker, which is only available with the CD. A real collectors pearl. You will love it!
