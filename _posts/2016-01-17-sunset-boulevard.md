On Sunday 17th, January I am turning into _Norma Desmond_ performing the final show of _Andrew Lloyd Webber's __**Sunset Boulevard**_ at the _Theater Bielefeld_, Germany. 

I would like to thank all the lovely people back- and on-stage for their professional support. Only with such a team I was able to pull out the necessary emotions that touched the critics and the audience in the same way.

Tonight the show will be sold-out and I guess it will be a magical derniere! And now Mr. DeMille it is time for the close-up ...
