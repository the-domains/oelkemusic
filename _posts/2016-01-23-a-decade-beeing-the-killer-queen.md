One year ago I was also having a great time in Vienna, playing the _Killer Queen_ in _**[WE WILL ROCK YOU][0]**_. ![Brian May & Roger Taylor, Brigitte Oelke (KiIller Queen) and the cast of WE WILL ROCK YOU](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/c8a363d5d7cde614f868997b8538d9bf933b8c66.jpg)

The coolest thing about it was that _Queen_ were playing in the same Venue at the same time. Brian, Roger and me were having the anniversary of playing the german production of _**[WE WILL ROCK YOU][0]**_ for more than a decade.  Aaaand I was having  a day-off. What a lovely twist of fate!

It was such a great pleasure to me meeting Brian and Roger again, after a long time. Sure, it was a bit crowdy because our whole cast was joining after playing the show. ![Brian MAy (Queen) & Brigitte Oelke (Killer Queen)](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/74482f9e09781146c0eace3d301a1abb1d8b037a.jpg)

At last I was able to give them a copy of my Rock-EP »**Discover Me !**« and having a quick but nice chat. They loved  it!
