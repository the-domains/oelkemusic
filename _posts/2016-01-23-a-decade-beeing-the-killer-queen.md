I was having a great time in Vienna in 2015, playing the _Killer Queen_ in _**[WE WILL ROCK YOU][0]**_

The coolest thing about it was that _Queen_ were playing in the same Venue at the same time. Brian, Roger and me were having the anniversary of playing thegerman production of _**[WE WILL ROCK YOU][0]**_ for more than a decade.  Aaaand I was having  a day-off. What a lovely twist of fate!

It was such a great pleasure to me meeting Brian and Roger again, after a long time. Sure, it was a bit crowdy because our whole cast was joining after playing the show. ![Brian MAy (Queen) & Brigitte Oelke (Killer Queen)](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/ae4b502dd7a5ae2b0b63f3985f90e8e543d1a8de.jpg)

At last I was able to give them a copy of my Rock-EP »**Discover Me !**« and having a quick but nice chat. They loved  it!
