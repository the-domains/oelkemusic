An underground party rouses a revue theatre that has stood empty for decades from a deep sleep. A young guest loses himself in the extraordinary aura of this stunning setting. The former theatre director rekindles the splendour and glamour of times past in his mind's eye. Past and present blur in a euphoric waking dream. While everything dissolves, floats and spins in front of him -- and even the floor disappears from beneath him -- he senses the support that he seeks: the person that means everything to him. THE ONE.

_Jean Paul Gaultier_ designed the over 500 daring, extravagant and glamorous costumes in person. He is one of the few genuine world stars of the fashion industry, a living legend of Parisian haute couture. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/add910a5-d4ab-4a7a-963a-2755c901b052.jpg)

The spectacular light design is by Emmy Award winner, _Peter Morse_, who previously worked for stars of the likes of _Michael Jackson_, _Madonna_, _Barbra Streisand_, _Prince_ and _Bette Midler_.

The dimensions are vast: more than 100 artists on the world's biggest theatre stage, a production budget of ten million euros, the most lavish show in Europe. One technical highlight of the new Grand Show is the stage floor, under which is a vast body of fluorescent water.
