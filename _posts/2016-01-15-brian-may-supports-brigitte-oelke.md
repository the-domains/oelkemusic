Since I knew I would become the worlds longest playing _Killer Queen_ of _WE  WILL ROCK YOU - The musical of Queen and Ben Elton_, I released a stunning Rock-EP called _**Discover Me ! **_
![Brigitte Oelke - Discover Me ! (EP)](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/ff12f3d49af59dab9b5dea906d5d71f1f812829c.jpg)

With a little help from my dear friend_Frank Rohles __, _this EP turned out to become a secret collectors item. To be honest, Frank put unbelievably much of his soul to this rockin' jewel. He constantly kept on working real hard to help me and do a great debut in rock music. For this I am very grateful. It is very important to work with trustworthy people like him. Especially as I produced this music by myself. ![Frank Rohles & Brigitte Oelke](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/d2ae1b735e95c4d1c3b8efb630d47eb67167cfe0.jpg)

_Frank Rohles_ aka _Mr. Rock'n'Rohles_ was the personal choice of _Brian May_ ([_Queen_][0]) to play the guitar for the german premiere of _WE WILL ROCK YOU - The musical by Queen and Ben Elton_. _Brian May_ also picked him to be the Guitar Supervisor for the following productions of _WWRY_ in Toronto and Zurich. _Frank Rohles_ is one of THE rare _Queen_-Experts, if it comes to the music, that the master himself, Mr. May, is listening to. Therefore _Mr. Rock'n'Rohles_ created a killer-cover-version of _Queen_'s _Don't Stop Me Now_ which I am performing on my EP - _DISCOVER ME !_  
And guess what ... Brian and Roger like it!

Frank also composed 4 new songs and one of them is an ode to the role of the  _Killer Queen_. I wonder if you can point it out? If you like Classic-Rock it is definitly worth buying. In this way you support me and my work the best. As for I am a self-producing artist, producing on a very high (and expensive) level, without the power of a major label, only to provide you and me an excellent audio recording with soul and guts.   
Support the artist!
