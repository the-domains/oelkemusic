It was an amazing final performance of _**SUNSET BLVD.**_ at the _Theater Bielefeld_. We were sold out and we all had that magical feeling of playing such a masterpiece for the final time. It was a great honor to me playing the role of _Norma Desmond_ and I guess my collegues will feel about playing their role in the same way.
