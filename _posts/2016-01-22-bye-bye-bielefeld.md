It was an amazing final performance of _Andrew Lloyd Webbe__r's_**_SUNSET BLVD._** at the _Theater Bielfeld_. We were sold out and we all had that magical feeling of playing such a masterpiece for the final time. It was a great honor to me playing the role of _Norma Desmond_ and I guess my colleagues will feel about playing their role in a similar way. It is always a great pleasure to play on this stage with that beautiful spirit and all this lovely and supporting people backstage.
