Before my latest album »**The Private Session Musicals Vol.1**« has been released, I was producing two amazing CDs. 

»**The Private Session**« -- Finest acoustic music with voice, guitar and piano  
»**Discover Me !**« -- Finest rock music by the actress of the original german  _Killer Queen_ from _[WE WILL ROCK YOU - The musical by Queen and Ben Elton][0]_

You can also get them digital on [iTunes][1] or Amazon.
