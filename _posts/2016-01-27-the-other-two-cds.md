![Brigitte Oelke - Killer Queen](https://scontent-frt3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xfp1/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/10940607_619608921478901_5579818368556586965_n.jpg?oh=5d44fefcb5a7f3c343451f26982845dc&oe=573BA8D2)

Before my latest album »**The Private Session Musicals Vol.1**« has been released, I was producing two amazing CDs. 

»**The Private Session**« -- Finest acoustic music with voice, guitar and piano  
»**Discover Me !**« -- Finest rock music by the actress of the original german  _Killer Queen_ from _[WE WILL ROCK YOU - The musical by Queen and Ben Elton][0]_

You can also get them digital on [iTunes][1] or Amazon.
