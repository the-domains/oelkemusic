Since I knew I would become the worlds longest playing _Killer Queen_ in _WE WILL ROCK YOU - The musical by Queen and Ben Elton_, I was releasing a stunning Rock-EP named: _**Discover Me !**_

With a little help from my dear friend, _Frank Rohles_ this EP turned out to become a secret collectors item. To be honest, Frank put unbelievably much of his soul to this rockin' jewel. He constantly kept on working real hard to help me and do a great debut in rock music. For this I am very grateful. Considering that I am producing on my own risk, it is very important to work with trustworthy people like him. Thank You, Frank!

_Frank Rohles_ aka _Mr. Rock'n'Rohles_ was the personal choice of _Brian May (Queen)_ to play the guitar for the german premiere of _WE WILL ROCK YOU - The musical by Queen and Ben Elton_. _Brian May_ also picked him to be the Guitar Supervisor for the following productions of _WWRY_ in _Toronto_ and _Zurich_. ![Brigitte Oelke - We Will Rock You](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/c677bb8f12dfa8dda28a6cd3ff448f4ae4e5c6be.jpg)

_Mr. Rock'n'Rohles_**** is one of the rare Queen-Experts, if it comes to the music, that the master himself, Mr. _May_, is listening to. Therefore _Frank Rohles_ created a killer-cover-version of _Queen's_ «_**Don't Stop Me Now»**_ which we perform on my EP - _**Discover Me !**_  
A must-have for every _Queen_-Fan ... and guess what ...   
Brian and Roger like it!

Frank also composed 4 new songs and one of them is an ode to the role of the _Killer Queen_. I wonder if you can point it out? If you like Classic-Rock it is definitly worth buying. In this way you support me and my work the best. I am a self-producing artist, producing on a very high (and expensive) level, without the power of a major label, only to provide you and me an excellent audio recording. 
Support the artist and try new music. Thank you!
