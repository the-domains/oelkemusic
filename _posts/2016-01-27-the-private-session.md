![Brigitte Oelke // The Private Session](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/6b3b9532-7630-40f1-a8b7-b31e69aabc22.jpg)

In 2010 we were founding our own little music label called [StagePeople][0]. The first release was in 2011 with the debut of »_**The Private Session**_«. The idea behind this album was to professionally minimalize some of the most beautiful pop- and rocksongs and purely present them only with vocals, guitar and piano. ![StagePeople LC27880](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/d160adb6e914bd1b127dd0035568a24f87a89760.png)

With the support of my dear friend [Frank Rohles][1] I was collecting my first experiences as a producer and the result is this beautiful piece of art.

»**_The Private Session LIVE_**« was also born in this time and since then I am playing in variously venues, e.g. LOK-Remise St. Gallen, Volksbühne Berlin (Grüner Salon), Theater Bielefeld, TAM Bielefeld. So watch out for my upcoming events. I would like to meet you in one of these »Private Sessions«.
