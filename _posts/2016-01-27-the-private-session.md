In 2010 we were founding our own little music label called StagePeople. The first release was in 2011 with the debut of »The Private Session«. The idea behind this album was to professionally minimalize some of the most beautiful pop- and rocksongs and purely present them only with vocals, guitar and piano.

With the support of my dear friend Frank Rohles I was collecting my first experiences as a producer and the result is this beautiful piece of art.

»The Private Session LIVE« was also born and since then I am playing in variously venues, e.g. LOK-Remise St. Gallen, Volksbühne Berlin (Grüner Salon), Theater Bielefeld, TAM Bielefeld. So watch out for my upcoming events. I would like to meet you in one of these »Private Sessions«.
